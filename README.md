# `hl` Command Documentation

The `hl` command is a CLI wrapper for fetching logs from your Heroku apps. It provides an easy way to view logs for your Heroku applications.

## Usage

```sh
hl [options]
```

## Options

- `-i, --index [index]`: Index of the app to log. Valid values are `1`, `2`, or `3`. If no index is provided, it defaults to the app name stored in `process.env.HCI_APP_1`.
- `-a, --app [app name]`: Logs for your Heroku app. If not provided, it defaults to the saved app name based on the index.

## Examples

### Default Usage

If no options are passed, the command will fetch logs for the app name stored in `process.env.HCI_APP_1`.

```sh
hl
```

### Using Index

To fetch logs for the app name stored in `process.env.HCI_APP_2`:

```sh
hl -i 2
```

### Using App Name

To fetch logs for a specific app name:

```sh
hl -a my-heroku-app
```

## Environment Variables

- `HCI_APP_1`: The default Heroku app name used when no options are provided.
- `HCI_APP_2`: The Heroku app name used when `-i 2` is specified.
- `HCI_APP_3`: The Heroku app name used when `-i 3` is specified.

### Notes

- Ensure that the environment variables `HCI_APP_1`, `HCI_APP_2`, and `HCI_APP_3` are set in your environment to use the index options effectively.
- The command uses the `heroku logs -a <app_name> --tail` command internally to fetch and display the logs in real-time.
